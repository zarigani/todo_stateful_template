= Ruby-GetText-Package-1.1.0 (2005-12-29)

 * Added some functions which managed po/mo files easily.
   * GetText.update_pofiles creates/updates pot/po files.
     The idea is from Sascha Ebach.

 * String% is extended to accept named argument. 
   "%{file} is selected." % {:file => "foo.rb"}
   Proposed by Sascha Ebach and Kazuhiro NISHIYAMA.

 * Enhanced Ruby on Rails support.
   * ActiveRecord support. Inspired from Simon Santoro(rgtrans).
     * the error messages are localized.
       Also, you can add your own messages with _("").
     * You can use gettext methods in the models unless
       preparing anything.

     * rgettext extracts the table names/field names
       of the subclass of ActiveRecord::Base as the msgid.

       Even for the English developers who don't need 
       to localize their application, this function is
       useful because the developer can rename 
       the table/field names using "en" locale.
 
     * More simple to set up ApplicationController.
       Now, you need to call just init_gettext only.
  
       class ApplicationController < ActionController::Base
         init_gettext "myapp"  #Easy!
       end

       This "myapp" domain affects all of the controllers/views/models.
